This paper presents an open-source neural machine translation toolkit named CytonMT\footnote{https://github.com/arthurxlw/cytonMt}. The toolkit is built from scratch only using C++ and NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated libraries. The toolkit features training efficiency, code simplicity and translation quality. Benchmarks show that cytonMT accelerates the training speed by 64.5\% to 110.8\% on neural networks of various sizes, and achieves competitive translation quality.
