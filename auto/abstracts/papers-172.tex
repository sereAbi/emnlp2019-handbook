Sexism is one of the most pervasive and detrimental forms of discrimination, manifesting in blatant as well as subtle ways. In the wake of growing documentation of experiences of sexism on the web, the automatic categorization of accounts of sexism has the potential to assist social scientists and policy makers in utilizing such data to study and counter sexism better. The existing work on sexism classification, which is different from sexism detection, is somewhat limited in terms of the categories used or the problem set-up or both. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on the multi-label classification of sexism beyond sexual harassment, and we contribute the largest dataset for sexism categorization. We develop a neural solution for this multi-label classification that can combine sentence representations obtained using models such as BERT with distributional and linguistic word embeddings using a flexible, hierarchical architecture involving recurrent components and optional convolutional ones. Further, we leverage unlabeled instances of sexism in order to infuse domain-specific elements into our framework. Our best method outperforms several deep learning as well as traditional machine learning baselines.
