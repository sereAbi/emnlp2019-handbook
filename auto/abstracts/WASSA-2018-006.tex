This paper introduces a gamified framework for fine-grained sentiment analysis and emotion detection. We present a flexible tool that can be used for efficient annotation based on crowd sourcing and a self-perpetuating gold standard. We also present a novel dataset with multi-dimensional annotations of emotions and sentiments in movie subtitles that enables research on sentiment preservation across languages and the creation of robust multilingual emotion detection tools. The tools and datasets are public and open-source and can easily be extended and applied for various purposes.
