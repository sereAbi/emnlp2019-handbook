{\bfseries Abstract:} Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping business and science. Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that solves complex societal problems by adopting AI-driven methods, processes, algorithms, and systems on data of various forms. This talk will review some of the latest advances in the research that focuses on fake news and legal liability. I will first discuss the structural, temporal, and linguistic traits of fake news propagation. One emerging challenge here is the increasing use of automated bots to generate and propagate false information. I will also discuss the current issues on the legal liability of AI and robots, particularly on how to regulate them (e.g., moral machine, punishment gap). This talk will suggest new opportunities to tackle these problems.
